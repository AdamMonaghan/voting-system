	<h1><b>Registration Complete</b></h1>

	<p>You have completed your registration and we have recieved your details.</p>

	<p>Soon, you will recieve a letter from us in the post that includes a voter code, similar to the one you
	used within your registration today. Like before, this code is unique, and will be needed for when you come to
	cast your ballot. Don't worry, this will also be explained - in more detail - in the letter we will send to you.
	It should be with you within <u>7</u> working days.</p>

	<p>Online voting will open approximately a week before, and close before, election day. This is so that
	we know who to expect in the polling boothes on the day of the election. Please note, <span style="color: red;"><b>if you vote online, you will
	be unable to vote in person on election day</b></span>.</p>

	<p>Thank you for registering.</p>
